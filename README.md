# object_info
Designed to print info about object (properties+methods results)

But why? if we can use debugger directly?
Reason:
1. to get and save standard text info,  
it useful to keep this info for future quick eye sight without exact condition like other OS or device/devlist/configuration 
2. in debugger we cant see result of methods!
3. 

## Features
1. print all properties and methods result (without params)
